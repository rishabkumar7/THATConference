# Introduction to LangChain

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

## About this talk

I am Rishab Kumar, a Staff Developer Evangelist at Twilio and I have given this talk at few conferences. There is a live coding aspect to the talk, the code for both projects that we build during the talk can be found in `pets-name` and `youtube-assistant`.
I talk about what is LangChain? And what are some of the core concepts within LangChain, then we try to build our AI/LLM powered app with the LangChain framework.

## Demo

I have a freeCodeCamp course on LangChain that is very similar to this talk.
